REST API SMS Gateway using python-gammu for USB GSM modems. Developed and tested with **SIM800L**; other modems may work but are community-supported.

## About

This add-on provides a complete SMS gateway solution for Home Assistant, replacing the deprecated "SMS notifications via GSM-modem" integration. It offers both REST API and MQTT interfaces for sending and receiving SMS messages through USB GSM modems.

**Based on** [pajikos/sms-gammu-gateway](https://github.com/pajikos/sms-gammu-gateway) (Apache License 2.0).

- **Notify Platform** support for alerts
- **Web UI** accessible through Ingress

## Prerequisites

- USB GSM modem supporting AT commands (see **Supported hardware** below)
- Modem must appear as `/dev/ttyUSB*` device
- SIM card with SMS capability
- Optional: MQTT broker for full integration

## Supported hardware

This add-on is **developed and tested exclusively with SIM800L** modems — that's the hardware the author owns and verifies releases against.

Other modems (Huawei, Quectel EC25, ZTE, etc.) **may work**, and many do, but they are **community-supported**: the author can't test or debug hardware he doesn't own. Modem-specific quirks — init failures (`Code 27`/`Code 14`), `GSM Network: Unknown`, voice calling, multipart timing — depend heavily on the individual modem's firmware and USB interface layout.

What this means in practice:
- ✅ **SIM800L issues** are first-class and will be investigated.
- 🤝 **Other modems**: I'm happy to point you in the right direction, and if the community figures out a working recipe I'll gladly link or incorporate it — but bug reports that require modem-specific hardware I can't reproduce may be closed as *not planned*.
- 💡 If your modem works with raw AT commands (e.g. via `microcom`) but not here, it's usually a startup-timing / unsolicited-message (URC) quirk specific to that modem family.

If reliable operation matters to you, a **SIM800L-based module is the recommended choice**.

## Installation

1. Add repository to your Home Assistant:
   ```
   https://github.com/pavelve/home-assistant-addons
   ```
2. Find **SMS Gammu Gateway** in add-on store
3. Click Install
4. Configure the add-on (see below)
5. Start the add-on

## 🐳 Standalone Docker (without HA Supervisor)

If you run Home Assistant as a manual Docker container (HA Container) — or you don't use Home Assistant at all — you can still run the gateway as a standalone Docker container. The MQTT auto-discovery will integrate it into HA the same way as the add-on.

> Thanks to [@mickeyreg](https://github.com/PavelVe/home-assistant-addons/issues/15#issuecomment-4582397033) for figuring this out.

**Limitations:**
- The HA Ingress web UI is not available — access the web UI directly on port `5000`.
- You'll need to manage the `options.json` file yourself instead of using the HA add-on UI.

> **Multiple instances:** Since v1.6.5 you can run multiple gateways on the same MQTT broker. Set a unique `mqtt_device_id` (e.g. `sms_gateway_2`) and matching `mqtt_topic_prefix` for each instance.

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PavelVe/home-assistant-addons.git
cd home-assistant-addons/sms-gammu-gateway/
```

### Step 2 — Create `run-standalone.sh`

The default `run.sh` uses `bashio` (Home Assistant Supervisor only). Create a standalone version next to it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Starting SMS Gammu Gateway..."

DEVICE_PATH=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('/data/options.json'))['device_path'])")
if [ ! -c "${DEVICE_PATH}" ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Device ${DEVICE_PATH} not found. Please check your GSM modem connection."
    echo "Available tty devices:"
    ls -la /dev/tty* || true
fi

cd /app
exec python3 -u run.py
```

Then point the Dockerfile at it:

```bash
sed -i.bak 's|run.sh|run-standalone.sh|g' Dockerfile
```

(Or edit `Dockerfile` manually — replace `run.sh` with `run-standalone.sh` in the `COPY` and `CMD` lines.)

### Step 3 — Create `options.json`

This file replaces the HA add-on configuration UI. Adjust values to your setup:

```json
{
  "device_path": "/dev/serial/by-id/usb-HUAWEI_Technology_HUAWEI_Mobile-if0",
  "pin": "",
  "ssl": false,
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin",
  "mqtt_enabled": true,
  "mqtt_host": "192.168.1.10",
  "mqtt_port": 1883,
  "mqtt_username": "your_mqtt_user",
  "mqtt_password": "your_mqtt_password",
  "mqtt_topic_prefix": "homeassistant/sensor/sms_gateway",
  "mqtt_device_id": "sms_gateway",
  "sms_monitoring_enabled": true,
  "sms_check_interval": 30,
  "sms_cost_per_message": 0.0,
  "sms_cost_currency": "EUR",
  "auto_delete_read_sms": false,
  "sms_delete_delay_seconds": 0,
  "missed_calls_monitoring_enabled": true,
  "incoming_call_auto_reset_seconds": 10,
  "voice_call_enabled": false
}
```

> **Tip:** Prefer a stable device path like `/dev/serial/by-id/...` over `/dev/ttyUSB0` — the latter can change after reboot or reconnect. See [Device Path Options](#device-path-options) below for details.

### Step 4 — Create `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  sms-gammu-gateway:
    image: sms-gammu-gateway
    container_name: sms-gammu-gateway
    restart: unless-stopped
    devices:
      - /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0
    volumes:
      - ./sms-gateway-data:/data
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    privileged: true
```

Adjust the `devices:` entry to match your actual modem device.

### Step 5 — Build and run

```bash
mkdir -p sms-gateway-data
cp options.json sms-gateway-data/options.json

docker build --build-arg BUILD_FROM=ghcr.io/home-assistant/amd64-base:3.19 -t sms-gammu-gateway .
docker compose up -d
docker logs -f sms-gammu-gateway
```

For other architectures replace `amd64-base` with `aarch64-base`, `armv7-base`, `armhf-base`, or `i386-base`.

After startup the modem should appear in Home Assistant under MQTT auto-discovered devices (assuming the MQTT integration is configured and pointed at the same broker).

To stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Configuration

### Basic Settings

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `device_path` | `/dev/ttyUSB0` | Path to your GSM modem device (see Device Path Options below) |
| `modem_baud_rate` | `115200` | Serial speed of the modem. A fixed number (recommended) avoids gammu's baud-rate auto-detection hanging on some modules (e.g. SIM800/SIM800C). Use `auto` for the old auto-detect behavior, or any custom value (`9600`, `460800`, …). |
| `urc_filter_enabled` | `true` | Filter out spurious modem status messages such as `OVER-VOLTAGE WARNNING` that can freeze gammu communication (typical for SIM800). Keep enabled unless you have a reason to disable. |
| `pin` | `""` | SIM card PIN (leave empty if no PIN) |
| `ssl` | `false` | Enable HTTPS |
| `username` | `admin` | API username |
| `password` | `password` | API password (change this!) |

#### Device Path Options

You can specify the modem path in two ways:

**Option 1: By device name (simple, but may change)**
```
/dev/ttyUSB0
```
⚠️ **Warning:** This path can change if you disconnect/reconnect the modem or add other USB devices.

**Option 2: By device ID (recommended, stable)**
```
/dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Serial-if00-port0
```
✅ **Recommended:** This path is unique and persistent across reboots and reconnections.

To find your modem's stable ID, run in Home Assistant terminal:
```bash
ls -la /dev/serial/by-id/
```

### MQTT Settings (Optional)

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `mqtt_enabled` | `false` | Enable MQTT integration |
| `mqtt_host` | `core-mosquitto` | MQTT broker hostname |
| `mqtt_port` | `1883` | MQTT broker port |
| `mqtt_username` | `""` | MQTT username |
| `mqtt_password` | `""` | MQTT password |
| `mqtt_topic_prefix` | `homeassistant/sensor/sms_gateway` | Topic prefix |
| `mqtt_device_id` | `sms_gateway` | Unique device identifier for HA auto-discovery. Change only when running multiple instances on the same MQTT broker (e.g. `sms_gateway_2`). |
| `sms_monitoring_enabled` | `true` | Auto-detect incoming SMS |
| `sms_check_interval` | `60` | SMS check interval (seconds) |

### Advanced Settings

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `sms_cost_per_message` | `0.0` | Cost per SMS (set to 0 to disable cost tracking sensor) |
| `auto_delete_read_sms` | `true` | Automatically delete SMS after reading |
| `sms_delete_delay_seconds` | `0` | Delay (0–300 s) before auto-deleting a read SMS; `0` = delete immediately |
| `missed_calls_monitoring_enabled` | `false` | Enable incoming/missed call detection (requires modem support) |
| `incoming_call_auto_reset_seconds` | `60` | Auto-reset incoming call state after N seconds (10-300) |
| `voice_call_enabled` | `false` | **Experimental:** Enable voice calls (see limitations below) |

### Example Configuration

```yaml
# Recommended: Use stable device ID
device_path: "/dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Serial-if00-port0"
# Or simple path (may change on reconnect):
# device_path: "/dev/ttyUSB0"

pin: ""
ssl: false
username: "admin"
password: "your_secure_password"
mqtt_enabled: true
mqtt_host: "core-mosquitto"
mqtt_port: 1883
mqtt_username: ""
mqtt_password: ""
sms_monitoring_enabled: true
sms_check_interval: 60
```

## 🏠 Home Assistant Integration

### Method 1: MQTT with Auto-Discovery (Recommended)

Enable MQTT in configuration and the add-on will automatically create:
- 📊 **GSM Signal Strength** sensor
- 🌐 **GSM Network** sensor
- 💬 **Last SMS Received** sensor
- ✅ **SMS Send Status** sensor
- 📱 **Phone Number** text input
- 💬 **Message Text** text input
- 🔘 **Send SMS** button
- ⚡ **Send Flash SMS** button (urgent alerts - displays on screen without saving)
- 📞 **Incoming Call** binary sensor (if enabled) - real-time ringing detection
  - State: ON = ringing, OFF = not ringing
  - Attributes: Number, ring_start, ring_count
- 📞 **Last Missed Call** sensor (if enabled)
  - State: caller phone number
  - Attributes: ring_start, ring_end, ring_duration_seconds, ring_count, processed_at
- 📞 **Dial Call** button (if voice calls enabled) - dial the number from Phone Number field
- 📞 **Outgoing Call** binary sensor (if voice calls enabled) - ON/OFF with number attribute

All entities appear under device **"SMS Gateway"** in Home Assistant.

### Method 2: RESTful Notify

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
notify:
  - name: SMS Gateway
    platform: rest
    resource: http://192.168.1.x:5000/sms
    method: POST_JSON
    authentication: basic
    username: admin
    password: your_password
    target_param_name: number
    message_param_name: message
```

![Actions Notify Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pavelve/home-assistant-addons/main/sms-gammu-gateway/images/actions-notify.png)

### Method 3: Direct Service Calls

Use in automations:

```yaml
# Normal SMS
service: mqtt.publish
data:
  topic: "homeassistant/sensor/sms_gateway/send"
  payload: '{"number": "+420123456789", "text": "Alert!"}'

# Flash SMS (displays on screen, not saved to inbox)
service: mqtt.publish
data:
  topic: "homeassistant/sensor/sms_gateway/send"
  payload: '{"number": "+420123456789", "text": "URGENT ALERT!", "flash": true}'
```

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Send SMS via Button
1. Go to **SMS Gateway** device in Home Assistant
2. Fill **Phone Number** field (e.g., +420123456789)
3. Fill **Message Text** field (max 255 characters)
4. Click **Send SMS** button
5. Message field auto-clears, number stays for next message

**Note:** Messages are limited to 255 characters due to MQTT message size constraints. Longer messages will be automatically split into multiple SMS parts by the GSM modem.

### Automation Example

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Door Alert SMS
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.door
      to: 'on'
    action:
      service: notify.sms_gateway
      data:
        message: 'Door opened!'
        target: '+420123456789'
```

### Call Monitoring Automations

```yaml
# Notification when phone is ringing
automation:
  - alias: "Phone Ringing Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.sms_gateway_incoming_call
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Incoming Call"
          message: "Calling: {{ state_attr('binary_sensor.sms_gateway_incoming_call', 'Number') }}"

# Notification for missed call
automation:
  - alias: "Missed Call Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.sms_gateway_last_missed_call
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Missed Call"
          message: >
            From: {{ states('sensor.sms_gateway_last_missed_call') }}
            Duration: {{ state_attr('sensor.sms_gateway_last_missed_call', 'ring_duration_seconds') }}s
```

### Voice Call Automations (Experimental)

> **Warning:** Voice call support is experimental. After each call, the modem needs ~2 minutes to recover. During this time, SMS and other modem operations are unavailable. See details below.

```yaml
# Doorbell alert - dial number (rings ~35s then ends automatically)
automation:
  - alias: "Doorbell Call Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.doorbell
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: rest_command.dial_call
        data:
          number: "+420123456789"
```

To use `rest_command.dial_call`, add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
rest_command:
  dial_call:
    url: "http://localhost:5000/calls/dial"
    method: POST
    content_type: "application/json"
    username: "admin"
    password: "your_password"
    payload: '{"number": "{{ number }}"}'
```

**Voice Call — How It Works:**

1. Addon sends `ATD` command to modem via Gammu `DialVoice()`
2. Phone rings for ~35 seconds (controlled by GSM network, not the addon)
3. Call ends automatically when the other party answers/rejects or network times out
4. **All modem operations are paused** during the call (SMS monitoring, signal checks, ReadDevice) to prevent serial port conflicts
5. After the call, a **~2 minute recovery** is needed:
   - 5 seconds: ReadDevice flushes `NO CARRIER` response from modem buffer
   - ~85 seconds: Gammu connection is re-initialized (`Terminate()` + `Init()`) and callbacks are re-registered
6. Normal operations resume automatically after recovery

**Limitations:**
- **Hangup is not supported** — GSM modems (SIM800C, SIM800L, etc.) don't respond to Gammu's `CancelCall` command during active voice calls (40s timeout, no effect). This is a known Gammu/modem limitation.
- **~2 min modem downtime** after each call — voice calls leave the modem in an inconsistent state that requires full Gammu re-initialization. During this time, SMS sending/receiving is temporarily unavailable.
- **No call duration control** — the call duration is determined by the GSM network timeout (~35s), not the addon
- **Disabled by default** — enable in addon config (`voice_call_enabled: true`)
- **Recommended for alarm/notification use only** — e.g., doorbell rings, security alerts where you just need to ring someone's phone

### REST API Examples

> **Note:** Port 5000 is the default. You can change it in Home Assistant add-on Network settings.

```bash
# Normal SMS
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.x:5000/sms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u admin:password \
  -d '{"text": "Test SMS", "number": "+420123456789"}'

# Flash SMS (urgent alert - displays on screen without saving)
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.x:5000/sms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u admin:password \
  -d '{"text": "URGENT!", "number": "+420123456789", "flash": true}'
```

```bash
# Dial voice call (rings ~40s then ends automatically)
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.x:5000/calls/dial \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u admin:password \
  -d '{"number": "+420123456789"}'
```

**Flash SMS Notes:**
- Flash SMS displays immediately on phone screen
- Message is NOT saved to inbox
- Ideal for urgent alerts and notifications
- Not all phones/carriers support Flash SMS (fallback to normal SMS)
- Some carriers may charge differently for Flash SMS

### Main Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| POST | `/sms` | Send SMS | Yes |
| GET | `/sms` | Get all SMS | Yes |
| GET | `/sms/{id}` | Get specific SMS | Yes |
| DELETE | `/sms/{id}` | Delete SMS | Yes |
| POST | `/calls/dial` | Dial voice call | Yes |
| GET | `/status/signal` | Signal strength | No |
| GET | `/status/network` | Network info | No |
| GET | `/status/reset` | Reset modem | No |

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found
- Check USB connection: `ls /dev/ttyUSB*`
- **Recommended:** Use stable device ID instead of `/dev/ttyUSB0`:
  ```bash
  ls -la /dev/serial/by-id/
  ```
- Verify device permissions
- Try different USB ports
- Check `dmesg | grep tty` for device detection

### Modem Freezes / SMS Not Being Read (SIM800 / SIM800C)
Symptoms: the addon initializes the device but every operation then times out
(`GetSignalQuality timed out`), no SMS are read, entities go unavailable.

Two common causes, both addressed since **v1.7.0**:
1. **Baud-rate auto-detection hangs.** Set `modem_baud_rate` to a fixed value
   (default `115200`). Most modems incl. SIM800/SIM800C work on `115200`.
2. **The modem floods the line with `OVER-VOLTAGE WARNNING`** (or similar power
   URCs), which interleave with AT responses and freeze gammu. Keep
   `urc_filter_enabled: true` (default) so these lines are filtered out before
   they reach gammu.

If after the update the modem does not start at all, try `modem_baud_rate: auto`.

### SMS Not Sending
- Check signal strength (should be > 20%)
- Verify SIM card has credit
- Ensure PIN is correct or disabled
- Check network registration status

### MQTT Not Working
- Verify MQTT broker is running
- Check MQTT credentials
- Look for connection errors in add-on logs
- Ensure topic prefix doesn't conflict
- If broker starts after addon, the addon auto-retries connection for up to 5 minutes

### Code 69 Error
- This is SMSC (SMS Center) issue
- Add-on automatically uses Location 1 fallback
- Works same as REST API

### Call Monitoring Not Working
Check addon logs for message "Call callback: NOT SUPPORTED".

**How it works:**
- Uses Gammu `SetIncomingCall()` callback for real-time detection
- `ReadDevice()` runs every 1s to process incoming events
- Does NOT require MC (Missed Calls) memory - works on SIM800L!

**Supported modems:**
- SIM800L, SIM800C, SIM800H (tested!)
- Huawei E3372, E173, E220
- Quectel M66, MC60, EC25
- Most modems with CLIP (Calling Line Identification) support

**If not working:**
- Check if modem supports CLIP (AT+CLIP=1)
- Try enabling/disabling and restart addon
- Some virtual modems may not support call events
